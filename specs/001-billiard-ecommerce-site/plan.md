# Implementation Plan: Billiard E-commerce Website

**Branch**: `001-billiard-ecommerce-site` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-billiard-ecommerce-site/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the development of a comprehensive personal billiard-selling website using ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server. The implementation will follow a clean architecture pattern, leveraging existing assets such as the database schema from `docs/database/database.sql` and UI templates from the `Template/` directory. The focus is on delivering a high-quality user experience for core e-commerce functionalities including product browsing, shopping cart management, and a simplified local checkout process.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: C# / .NET 9.0
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core 9.0, AutoMapper
**Storage**: SQL Server (schema defined in `docs/database/database.sql`)
**Testing**: xUnit (NEEDS CLARIFICATION - No test project found, xUnit is recommended)
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web Application (Clean Architecture: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Web)
**Performance Goals**: Page loads under 3 seconds.
**Constraints**: Local execution only; no online payment gateway integration.
**Scale/Scope**: Small-scale e-commerce site, expected to handle <100 concurrent users.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle Adherence**: The plan to use a clean, layered architecture aligns with general principles of creating maintainable and testable software.
- **Test-First**: A testing framework is not yet present. This will be addressed in Phase 0. Adherence to TDD is **critical**.
- **Violations**: No violations of standard software engineering principles are anticipated.

**Structure Decision**: The existing source code follows a clean (onion) architecture. The plan will adhere to this structure, placing new components in their respective layers. A new `tests` directory will be created at the root to house unit and integration tests.

## Complexity Tracking

No violations requiring justification.
